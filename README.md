# 4 TASK: Pair of employees who have worked together

This project combines everything learned so far during sirma academy. The main programming language used for the backend creation of this software is Java, combined with a PostgreSQL database and frontend HTML and CSS.

From what I understand, the project's goal is to parse information from a .csv file containing employee details and their respective projects. The format you're aiming for is:
**EmpID, ProjectID, DateFrom, DateTo**
**143, 12, 2013-11-01, 2014-01-05**
**218, 10, 2012-05-16, NULL**
**143, 10, 2009-01-01, 2011-04-27**

All employees who work on the same project are extracted from the period that is working on the project.
